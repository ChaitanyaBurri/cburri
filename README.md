Causality of Airbnb Superhost Status
Backdrop
Airbnb's Superhost certification program distinguishes hosts who provide exceptional service. The criteria for earning Superhost status requires hosts to meet specific standards over the preceding year.

Problem Statement
This project aims to investigate whether having Superhost status on Airbnb influences occupancy rates.

Dataset Overview
The analysis utilizes Airbnb booking data across eight Superhost evaluation periods between 2016 and 2018. The dataset consists of records from New York with a total of 64,104 rows of data for the periods considered.

Methodology
To isolate the impact of Superhost status on occupancy, the analysis focuses on properties that nearly missed or just gained Superhost status between two consecutive evaluation periods. The study identifies control (just missed) and treatment (just gained) groups to compare occupancy changes.

Analysis
The initial findings suggest an increase in occupancy rates for the treatment group in the latest evaluation period. Further regression analysis with an interaction term will be conducted to quantify the effect of Superhost status on occupancy rates.
